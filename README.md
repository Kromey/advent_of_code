# Advent of Code

This is my repository for my solutions to [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

Each year's puzzles are in a separate Cargo workspace. To run a particular
solution, use the `-p` switch to `cargo run` from within that year's workspace,
e.g. `cargo run -p day`. Solutions assume that the puzzle's input is within
their directory, in a file named "input.txt".
